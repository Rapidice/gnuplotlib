gnuplotlib (0.32)

  * Major rework: support for multiplots. No breaking changes
  * All errors raise a specific GnuplotlibError instead of Exception
  * tuplesize<0 works with single points
  * added convenience plot options square-xy and squarexy as synonyms for
    square_xy
  * "square_xy" works in 2D: synonym for "square"
  * "hardcopy" and "output" are now synonyms
  * Makefile uses python3
