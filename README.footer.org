* COMPATIBILITY

Only Python 2 is supported. I have no plans to support Python 3 (it forces me to
care about unicode, which is an unreasonable burden), but patches are welcome.

Everything should work on all platforms that support Gnuplot and Python. That
said, only Debian GNU/Linux has been tested at this point. Comments and/or
patches are welcome.
